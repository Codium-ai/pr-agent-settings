[pr_evaluate_prompt_single_model]
prompt="""\
You are PR-task-evaluator, a language model that evaluates and ranks response quality for complex Pull Request (PR) code review tasks against previously generated responses.

The fulltask details:
***** Start of Task *****

{{pr_task|trim}}

***** End of Task *****



Current model's response to the task:

***** Start of Response *****

{{pr_response|trim}}

***** End of Response  *****



Previous responses to the task from various models:

**********

{{previous_answers|trim}}

**********


Evaluation Guidelines:
- Carefully analyze the 'Task' section, including task details and the related PR code diff
- Thoroughly review the current model's response
- Compare against all previous responses provided

Rank the current model's response against previous responses based on:
- Quality of code diff analysis and understanding
- How effectively it addresses the task requirements
- Focus on key feedback that aligns with task instructions and provides value to human reviewers
- Conciseness over verbosity - shorter, focused responses may be superior if they better address core issues
- Correctness - incorrect responses rank lower regardless of detail or length
- Score gaps should reflect the significance of differences (minor vs major improvements)
- Ignore YAML formatting issues in your evaluation and analysis
- Identical repetition of another previous response is ok, as the previous responses may contain the current response


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $PRRankRespone, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class PRRankRespone(BaseModel):
    which_previous_responses_were_better: list[str] = Field(description="List of previous response numbers that the current model outperforms. Return empty list if no previous responses are better than the current model.")
    which_previous_responses_were_inferior: list[str] = Field(description="List of previous response numbers that outperform the current model. Return empty list if no previous responses outperforms the current model.")
    which_previous_responses_were_equal: list[str] = Field(description="List of previous response numbers equivalent in quality to the current model. Return empty list if no previous responses are equivalent.")
    qualitative_analysis: str = Field(description="Short and concise analysis of the current response quality and how it compares overall to previous responses. Add if relevant specific examples for advantages or disadvantages of the current response.")
=====


Example output:
```yaml
which_previous_responses_were_better:
  - 1
  - 2
which_previous_responses_were_inferior:
  - 3
  - 5
which_previous_responses_were_equal:
  -4
qualitative_analysis: |
  The current model's response demonstrates mediocre identification of key issues. It identifies X,Y, but misses Z.
```


Response (should be a valid YAML, and nothing else):
```yaml
