   - title: "Avoids Obvious Performance Issues"
     compliance_label: true
     objective: "Prevent performance degradation by avoiding inefficient loops, N+1 queries, or excessive memory use"
     success_criteria: "Code is optimized with efficient algorithms and database query patterns"
     failure_criteria: "Inefficient loops, N+1 database queries, or excessive memory consumption"

   - title: "Follows Existing Patterns"
     compliance_label: true
     objective: "New code must be consistent with established architecture and design patterns in the codebase"
     success_criteria: "Code follows existing patterns for separation of concerns, dependency injection, etc."
     failure_criteria: "Code that breaks established patterns or introduces inconsistent architecture"

   - title: "Manages State and Side Effects"
     compliance_label: true
     objective: "Ensure functions are predictable by avoiding global state modifications and minimizing side effects"
     success_criteria: "Functions are pure where possible, state changes are localized and explicit"
     failure_criteria: "Unexpected global state modifications or unpredictable side effects"
