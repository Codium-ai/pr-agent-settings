<b>Pattern 4: Add comprehensive docstrings to functions and methods, especially those with complex parameters or behavior, to improve code maintainability and understanding.</b>

Example code before:
```
def get_diff_code(self, file_path: str, improved_code: str, start_line: int) -> str:
    try:
        # Get the current diff file
```

Example code after:
```
def get_diff_code(self, file_path: str, improved_code: str, start_line: int) -> str:
    """
    Generate a diff patch between the current code and improved code for a given file.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the file being modified
        improved_code (str): The new improved code to compare against current
        start_line (int): Starting line number in the file where changes begin
        
    Returns:
        str: A unified diff patch showing the changes between current and improved code
    """
    try:
        # Get the current diff file
```
